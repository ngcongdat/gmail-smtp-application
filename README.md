## Fix errors

- If you’ve turned on  `2-Step Verification`  for your account, you might need to enter an  [App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185834?hl=en#ASPs).
- `Important`: If you’re still having problems, visit  [http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha](https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)  and sign in with your Gmail username and password. If necessary, enter the letters in the distorted picture.
